# Facial-Recognition
This is a project done as a part of the course Mathematical Foundation for Data Science(CH5019) at IITM.

Here are the key points of the project,

– Used Principal Component Analysis for dimensionality reduction on a database of human faces for facial recognition.

– Eigen faces were used for facial recognition by projecting individual image vectors onto the Eigen space.

– The model was able to recognize unknown faces using minimum Euclidean distance with 99.39 % accuracy
